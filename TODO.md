* Enemies move slower when zoomed out? Delta?
* Why do enemies show lock behind them? One of the two is transparent?
* Add animations to engine and animate conveyor
* Add click drag to create conveyors
* Clean up index. Index should be slim and instantiate the game object
* Can we handle bad ratios screen sizes? Auto adjust canvas size to css size or similar?
* Add sound
* Librarify the engine
* Make ScoreBoard generic
* Fans get loud when I zoom out. Tileset should probably store static version of game field.

* Jackson found a bug where lock broke and wouldn't show a number. Recreated by building unlocker twice over lock.
* Game runs very slow on his computer
